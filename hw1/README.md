# CME 342 - Homework 1

## Problem 1
My interest in parallel programming deals mostly with solving PDEs for different physical problems. I do research using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and use codes that utilize MPI and OpenMP. I am also interested in GPU computing and Modern Fortran, which uses Coarrays. For a final project, I might like to reprogram the homework assignments using Modern Fortran and Opencoarrays, to see how the performance compares.
